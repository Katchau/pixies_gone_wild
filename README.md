pixiJS try out

I used npm for running a local server. For this used http-server.

The following commands are necessary if you don't have a local server to test:
1ยบ npm i (on the folder of the project)
2ยบ npm install http-server -g
3ยบ http-server (Then go to localhost:8080 and navigate to the public folder and there you go!)
